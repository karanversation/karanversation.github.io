**Summary**\
With rapid urbanisation, the country is facing massive waste management
challenge. Over 377 million urban people generate 62 million tonnes of
municipal solid waste per annum. Alongside, per annum more than 1 lakh
crore worth of food is wasted. On the other side, with population below
poverty line reaching 25 per cent, and one out of three malnourished
children in the world being Indian, we can most efficiently employ the
principle of "One man's trash is another man's treasure". Interactive
platforms can be used to register unused items, converting the location
to a 'collection point', which can be intelligently communicated to a
'needy' citizen. Fairness in doing the same can be ensured through rich
analytics utilising Aadhaar, BPL card, Ration card information to
identify the real needy and using a round-robin method, equitable
distribution can be made possible. Imagine being able to materially
support and feed millions just through correct propagation of
information.

**Problem**\
According to statistics published in ILO-WIEGO 2013, waste pickers in
India represent less than 0.1 per cent of the urban workforce. This
results in extensive waste mismanagement, often resulting in Unused
goods being discarded blindly. For almost 25 per cent of the population
living below Poverty line, such Unused goods can be an invaluable
resource. Food Wastage Costs India ₹1 Lakh Crore Every Year. According
to UN Food and Agricultural Organization, every third malnourished child
is Indian. This food can be utilized to feed millions.

**Solution**\
A multi-platform (Web, App, SMS) portal for the public, where people can
upload details of their Unused goods. Also, details of spare food (Ex:
From Events, Restaurants, etc.) can be uploaded. Through Information
based on BPL card holding and Ration card transactions, 'needy'
individuals can be identified. Corresponding Aadhaar details can be used
to connecting them to a closely located 'collection-point', with
information sent via SMS. Using round-robin method, fair distribution of
unused goods and food can be ensured and wastage can be reduced to a
minimum.

**Impact**\
Through intelligent 'demand-driven' distribution of unused items,
substantial waste management can automatically be brought into practice.
Through rich and intelligent analytics, reachability of such resources
to the real 'needy' can be ensured, resulting in fairness of
distribution and fostering trust in citizens. Food collected from
collection points can feed entire families, and communities, employing
food security and decreasing malnourishment in children. A way to
realize "One man's trash is another man's treasure"
