# wtf-ython

*(Nano-blog alert)*

```python
In [1]: bool(...)
Out[1]: True
```

```python
In [2]: a = 1_00_000
```

```python
In [3]: for x in [1, 2, 3]:
   ...:     if x > 5:
   ...:         break
   ...: else:
   ...:     print('Nice')
   ...:
Nice
```

Getting to know none of these throw a syntax error = Mind blown ^_^
